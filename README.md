A native Apple Silicon in-game console, cheat menu, and item browser for Cyberpunk 2077 on macOS. Think Cyber Engine Tweaks, rebuilt from scratch for the native macOS/Apple Silicon build of the game: inject into the running process, resolve REDengine's runtime type system, call game functions with real typed arguments, and draw a console on the live frame with a Metal overlay you drive from the keyboard.

> Renamed from "CET Mac" to "NightCity Console for Mac" to avoid confusion with Cyber Engine Tweaks. This is an independent, macOS-native project and is not affiliated with CET, WolvenKit, REDmod, CD PROJEKT RED, or Cyberpunk 2077. Single-player, personal use, on your own legally-owned copy. Back up your saves before using it.

## Status

macOS arm64 (Apple Silicon, M1/M2/M3/M4). Built and verified against Cyberpunk 2077 v2.3.1 (Steam). Experimental GOG support is available via `runtime/red4ext_hooks_gog.js` (see [docs/GOG.md](docs/GOG.md)); the default script targets the Steam macOS build.

## What it does

- In-game ImGui console drawn on the live frame (Metal), keyboard-driven, with tabbed views (Cmd+1/2/3), command history, and clipboard support (Cmd+V/C/X/A).
- Searchable item browser backed by a bundled catalog of 7,552 items. Browse by category (Weapons, Cyberware, Clothes, Crafting, Mods, Misc) or type to filter, press Enter to spawn the top match, no hunting for ids.
- Pinned favorites that persist across restarts, surfaced in a Quick tab so your go-to gear is one keypress away.
- One-click cheats: money, full heal, perks, attributes, relic points, set character level.
- Godmode that registers with the engine godmode system and auto-reapplies across scene and vehicle transitions.
- Invisibility (line-of-sight and detection break), infinite ammo, and world toggles (time of day, slow motion, disable police response).
- Teleport with saved position bookmarks (save a spot, return to it later).
- A generic `call <Class> <Method>` bridge that can invoke any observed RTTI method, plus quest-fact editing.
- Action confirmations: every command reports exactly what it did at the bottom of the overlay.
- Native Mods tab that lists, enables, and disables loose `.archive` mods by renaming `.archive` to `.archive.off`.

See [docs/COMMANDS.md](docs/COMMANDS.md) for the full command list and known limits.

## Requirements

- Apple Silicon Mac (arm64). Intel is not supported.
- macOS 26 or newer; tested on macOS 26 and 27.
- Cyberpunk 2077 v2.3.1, macOS, Steam build.
- A legally-owned copy of the game. No CD PROJEKT RED files are distributed by this project.

## Install and usage (players)

Prefer a walkthrough? Watch the install and usage video:

[![Watch the install and usage video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/VOUMaNLSAV0/hqdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/VOUMaNLSAV0)

1. Download `NightCity-Console-for-Mac.dmg` from [Releases](../../releases).
2. Open it and drag NightCity Console into your Applications folder.
3. Open NightCity Console, click Install, then Play.
4. In-game, press the backtick/tilde key (`` ` ``) or F1 to open the console.

No Terminal, no file editing. The app finds your game, installs the runtime files (re-signing the game binary so the console can load), and launches it. Steam Cloud saves keep working.

Updating from an older version: after replacing the app, click Install once (it reads "Reinstall NightCity Console"), then Play. No need to uninstall first.

### Using the console in-game

The game captures the mouse during play, so the overlay is keyboard-driven. Switch tabs with Cmd+1 / Cmd+2 / Cmd+3:

- Console (Cmd+1): type commands directly. Up/Down for history, Cmd+V to paste, `help` for the list.
- Items (Cmd+2): browse by category (Cmd+G cycles categories) or type to search the 7,552-item catalog. Enter spawns the top match, Cmd+P pins it to favorites. Set the quantity first if you want a stack.
- Quick (Cmd+3): one-click cheats, your pinned favorites, and teleport bookmarks.

Common commands (full list in [docs/COMMANDS.md](docs/COMMANDS.md), or `help` in-game):

```text
give Items.Preset_Silverhand_3516 1       # Johnny's Malorian
money 50000
perks 10
level 50
heal
teleport save home    then    teleport home
Game.AddToInventory("Items.MaxDOSE", 5)    # CET-style line, also works
```

## Build (from source)

```bash
git clone <this repo> && cd nightcity-console-mac
./tools/fetch-deps.sh        # pulls FridaGadget + RED4ext into deps/ (copies from a local install if present)
./dev/launch.sh              # builds the overlay, stages the payload into your game, and launches it
```

`dev/launch.sh` honors `CP2077_DIR` if your game is not at the default Steam path. The third-party runtime binaries (`RED4ext.dylib`, `FridaGadget.dylib`) are not committed (see `.gitignore`); they are fetched into `deps/` and bundled into the release `.dmg`.

To build the signed, notarized app for distribution, run `tools/sign-notarize.sh` (needs an Apple Developer ID). It re-signs everything inside-out with a hardened runtime, notarizes the `.app` and the `.dmg` with `notarytool`, staples the tickets, and produces both a `.dmg` and a `.zip` in `dist/`.

Key source files:

- `runtime/red4ext_hooks.js`: the command engine (RTTI resolution, function calls, all commands).
- `overlay/overlay.mm`: the Metal/ImGui overlay and input handling.
- `launcher/`: the SwiftUI macOS app that installs and launches the game.

## How it works (short version)

NightCity Console injects three dylibs into the arm64 game process with `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` (no SIP changes): the macOS RED4ext hooking framework, the Frida gadget (an in-process script host), and a native Metal/ImGui overlay. It resolves REDengine's RTTI registry, then drives the script VM (the universal script executor) to call game functions with typed arguments built into a synthetic script stack frame. The console UI is Dear ImGui drawn from a `presentDrawable:` swizzle; input comes from an `NSApplication.sendEvent:` swizzle. The command engine and the overlay are decoupled and communicate over a small file channel in `/tmp`.

On Install, the launcher re-signs the game binary ad-hoc with the `allow-jit` and `allow-unsigned-executable-memory` entitlements. The stock Steam signature omits these, and without them macOS kills the game the moment the injected JIT engine generates code. Nothing is permanent: Steam's "Verify Integrity of Game Files" restores the original signature at any time.

For the full reverse-engineering and architecture write-up (offsets, struct layouts, calling convention, the bugs found and how they were fixed), see [TECHNICAL.md](TECHNICAL.md). For the complete macOS modding platform (RED4ext, RED4ext.SDK, TweakXL, ArchiveXL, and the console runtime), see [docs/MACOS-MODDING-PLATFORM.md](docs/MACOS-MODDING-PLATFORM.md).

## Compatibility and caveats

- The default engine targets the Steam macOS build. The GOG build differs structurally (offsets + non-virtual RTTI); experimental GOG support is available via `runtime/red4ext_hooks_gog.js` — see [docs/GOG.md](docs/GOG.md).
- Built against v2.3.1. Game updates can move offsets and break it. Releases are tagged per supported game version.
- Single-player only. Modding can corrupt saves, so keep backups.
- Install re-signs the game binary (ad-hoc) so the console can load. This is reversible at any time via Steam's "Verify Integrity of Game Files".
- macOS arm64 only.

## Support

This is free and open source. If it saved you some hassle and you want to support development, you can buy me a coffee. Completely optional, and very appreciated.
